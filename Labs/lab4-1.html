                Urban farming is a growing trend, especially those focused on growing food.  Whether the purpose of your efforts is

                and relaxing hobby, the following tips support all successful city farming efforts.

                <li>Make city farmer friends in your area. Every climate and growing season is different.  Learning what specific 
                    herbs or vegetables work well in your area is essential to success.</li>
                <li>Start small.  Pick a couple of things that are easy and reliable as starters.</li>
                <li>Use good soil.  Healthy plants cannot grow without it.  You may need to add compost, 
                    nitrogen, or phosphorus. Again, the veterans in your area can help you develop good soil.</li>
                <li>Plants need sunlight.  Generally vegetables can use as much sunlight as possible, but some
                    leafy greens will do well in shaded areas too.</li>
                <li>Plants need water.  It's hard to overwater vegetables, but each plant tolerates variations in moisture differently.  
                    Generally, a little water often is your best bet.</li>
                <li>Keep the weeds out.  Weeds waste valuable space, moisture and nutrients. Weeding your garden also gives you the 
                    chance to study your crop and make adjustments.</li>
